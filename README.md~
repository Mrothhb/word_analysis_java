#Summary
1.The WordCountContainer was approached in a Test Driven Development process 
which invloved writing and implementing tests against the methods in the
WordCountContainer class before the class methods were written down to code. 
This format of writing code makes for more roubust code, with less errors and 
bugs.
2.
	a. WordCountContainerTester.java: this file was disigned to implement 
	testing code against the code written for the WordCount program. The 
	WordCountContainerTester.java file will have various tests that will 
	ensure the program in WordCount and WordCountContainer is operating
	at its best capacity with the least amount of errors or holes.
	b. WordCountContainer.java: this file is designed to hold in memory all
	of the WordCount words that are passed as input into the WordCount 
	program. The WordCountContainer is just that, a container for all the 
	words in the WordCount program. a List of all the words. various 
	operations can be performed on the list of words in the container. 
	A short list of operations that can be performed on the list of words
	is: the ability to read a text file, store the words in the text file, 
	count the amount of words and the frequency of each word, write the 
	words to a new file, remove specific words from the list of words, and
	find the top N words in the text file.
